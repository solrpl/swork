This is a *very* simple framework for workflow.

Goals:
 * simple
 * programmer-friendliness - most bugs detected on compile time

Usage:

		Collection<Stage<YourRequest, YourResponse>> stages = ...
		YourRequest request = ...
		
		Workflow<YourRequest, YourResponse, YourStateModel> workflow = new Workflow<YourRequest, YourResponse, YourStateModel>();

		workflow.addAllStages(stages);
		workflow.addOutput(new ConvertRequestResponseOutputStage<YourRequest, YourResponse>());
		
		YourResponse response = workflow.process(request);

		
Todo:
 * branches
 * state achieved when all contributors were executed
